                               As my first Computer Science project, I was instructed to develop a program that prints out a worm
                               and a ledge. Based off of the commands passed into the function, the worm would perform actions.
                               Arrays were restricted from use, therefore I made a creative way to store data with brute force algorithms.

                                This projcet required knowledge in memory allocation and memory management.
                                The requirement was to utilize the minimal amount of memory required to store as much data as needed.
                                The data was stored into an allocated struct, which held data which also inlucded allocated arrays.
                                The user had multiple optons to modify the data with, such as adding data, removing, resetting all the
                                data, destroy specific data and a few more options. If all the data in an allocated memory location was destroyed,
                                the memory would be free'd, and so forth.

                                a few functions within this project that created to play with trees and to display my capability of
                                handling tree traversals, comparing multiple trees, comparing multiple trees' traversals, handling memory
                                allocations and recursion.
