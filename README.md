# Dodge
In this game, the WASD keys are used to dodge the spawning objects, every new level
there are new threats and the more that the player gets hit then
the more damage they will take. The goal is to stay alive longer than
anyone else, doing so will grant you a lot of points! This is my first major Java based game.
The engine was created using a tick FPS system. The GUI was created using the JFrame class
withing Java's JDK Framework.
<ul>
  <li>Programed in Java using Eclipse and the JDK framework</li>
  <li>Displays knowledge for creating own GUI using JFrame</li>
  <li>Engine created using a tick based system</li>
</ul>
